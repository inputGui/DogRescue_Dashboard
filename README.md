# DogRescue_Dashboard
Project Two submission for CS-340-T4222 Client/Server Development


## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
For any software project, writing maintainable, legible, and adaptive programs is crucial. One method I followed was to write modular code, use descriptive and clear variable and function names, implement correct error handling and logging, and adhere to accepted coding standards and practices. In Project One, the development of a CRUD Python module enabled a distinct separation of concerns, simplifying the management of the codebase. As the CRUD module can be changed independently of the dashboard and reused in other projects that require comparable database interactions, this method improves maintainability, readability, and adaptability.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
In order to solve a problem effectively, computer scientists must first analyze the requirements and constraints, divide the problem into smaller jobs, develop algorithms and data structures, and then iteratively construct, test, and debug the solution. In order to meet Grazioso Salvare's database and dashboard demands, I first assessed the client's requirements, looked into the relevant technologies, then planned and put the solution into practice. In contrast to earlier projects in other courses, this methodical and structured approach to problem-solving may be customized to meet the unique needs and restrictions of each project.


## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists play a vital role in developing algorithms, data structures, and software systems to solve complex problems in various domains.Computer scientists work makes it possible for companies, groups, and people to efficiently and productively use technology. A computer scientist's work on a project like this would benefit a business like Grazioso Salvare by streamlining processes, enabling data-driven decisions through an intuitive dashboard, increasing the effectiveness of their rescue operations, and fostering teamwork. The ability of a corporation to accomplish its objectives and maintain its competitiveness in the market might ultimately be greatly impacted by the work of a computer scientist on this kind of project.
